## This repository contains the contents of the lecture notes Advanced methods in Nonlinear control, as well as a summary to the course and exercises 


- the **lecture notes** are in [amnc](https://github.com/therealtoby1/Advanced-methods-Nonlinear-control/blob/main/amnc_ss24.pdf)
- the respective **lecture note summary** is in [Advanced Methods in Nonlinear control summary](https://github.com/therealtoby1/Advanced-methods-Nonlinear-control/blob/main/Advanced%20Methods%20in%20Nonlinear%20control%20summary.pdf)
- The **exercise tasks** can be found in the [Tasksheet](https://github.com/therealtoby1/Advanced-methods-Nonlinear-control/blob/main/Tasksheet.pdf)
- the **official solution** is in [solution](https://github.com/therealtoby1/Advanced-methods-Nonlinear-control/blob/main/solution.pdf)
- the **solution by hand** is in [Ãœbungsaufgaben](https://github.com/therealtoby1/Advanced-methods-Nonlinear-control/blob/main/%C3%9Cbungsaufgaben.pdf)
- the **solutions to the coding exercises** are provided as jupyter notebook files [Aufgabe 2-1](https://github.com/therealtoby1/Advanced-methods-Nonlinear-control/blob/main/Aufgabe_2_1.ipynb) and [Aufgabe 4-1](https://github.com/therealtoby1/Advanced-methods-Nonlinear-control/blob/main/Aufgabe_4_1.ipynb)
  
Note that i was too lazy to create a venv and a requirements file to run the code in. All that should be needed is numpy and scipy (and matplotlib if you want to visualize the system)
